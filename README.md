# invasive_species

For project 3, our goal is to place recent sightings of invasive species on an interactive map. To do this, we will be using the iNaturalist API and some basic web scraping. 

https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/

This is the documentation for the iNatualist API. Using this we will pull recent sightings of invasive species and get their coordinates so they can be placed on the map.

This link is for a simple list of invasive species that can be scraped and used to do separate API calls to assemble our database.
